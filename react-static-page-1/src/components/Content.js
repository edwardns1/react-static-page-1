            <p>The Tortoise and the Hare tells the story of a race between an energetic but arrogant hare and a slow-moving tortoise. Confident in his speed, the hare dashes far ahead of the tortoise and, seeing how much of a lead he has, decides to take a nap. The tortoise, though much slower, keeps moving forward without stopping.</p>
            <p>While the hare sleeps, the tortoise continues on and eventually gets close to the finish line. When the hare finally wakes up, he realizes his mistake and sprints toward the end, but the tortoise has already crossed the finish line. The slow but steady tortoise wins the race, leaving the hare shocked and defeated.</p>
